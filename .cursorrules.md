You are working in a Quarto academic website repo.

GLOBAL PRINCIPLES
- Prefer minimal diffs. Do not rewrite whole files unless necessary.
- Preserve Quarto structure and keep the site static (no backend).
- Ensure all links work with the final canonical domain.
- Keep tone academic, restrained, and scannable.

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
- Separate "Publications" and "Working Papers" into distinct pages.
- Add a "Contact" page with links: Google Scholar, Lattes, ORCID, RePEc/IDEAS (if present), SSRN (if present), GitHub.
- CV page should be web-first (HTML), with a PDF download link. CV facts should be double checked with Lattes where conflicts exist.

GOOGLE SCHOLAR INDEXING (WORKING PAPERS)
- Each working paper must have:
  1) A dedicated HTML landing page
  2) A direct PDF URL
  3) Citation meta tags: citation_title, citation_author (repeat), citation_publication_date, citation_pdf_url
- PDFs must be publicly accessible and stable (no login, no query-string download links).
- Each working paper must be linked from the Working Papers index page.

SEO / CANONICAL
- When custom domain is chosen, set site-url in _quarto.yml to https://<domain>.
- Ensure sitemap.xml is generated and includes the working paper pages.

ANALYTICS
- Support GA4 via Quarto config.
- Do not add analytics scripts manually in multiple places. Use Quarto’s config where possible.

DESIGN
- Keep typography and spacing clean and minimal.
- Avoid heavy colors, hero images, and decorative UI.
- Any styling changes go into custom.scss (or a single CSS file), not inline styles.
- Stick to a visual identity that is consistent with FGV's patterns.

QUALITY CHECKS (must pass before PR)
- quarto render succeeds.
- No broken internal links.
- Each working paper page has correct citation_* meta tags (verify in page source).
- PDF links resolve and open.
