    "section": "",
    "text": "We study the distributional effects of monetary policy in a developing economy with extensive employment informality. In particular, we examine how monetary policy impacts labor income growth and employment transitions using micro-level panel data. Adopting high-frequency identification, we construct a series of monetary policy surprises for Brazil that serves as an external instrument in a proxy-SVAR, thus allowing us to recover monetary policy shocks. Following a monetary contraction, both formal and informal workers experience declines in real income, with effects that are similarly pronounced across the low and middle-income quartiles, while higher earners suffer less. A monetary contraction also reduces the likelihood of large income gains, shifting the income growth distribution leftward. Moreover, a shock that raises the interest rate increases informality and unemployment persistence by making transitions to formal employment less frequent.\nDownload PDF"

    "text": "How do minimum wages affect earnings inequality in countries with large informal sectors? We provide reduced-form evidence that the 2000s minimum wage hike in Brazil raised overall inequality by increasing inequality within the informal sector. We develop a model where heterogeneous firms select into informality to investigate when and how raising the minimum wage can increase inequality. We calibrate the model to Brazil and find that, by generating substantial informality, the increase in the minimum wage raised overall inequality by 4.1%. These results highlight how movements into and out of the informal sector modulate the effects of formal labor legislation.\nDownload PDF"
